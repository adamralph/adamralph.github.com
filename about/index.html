<h2>About me</h2>

<p>I'm just a lowly programmer at a company that doesn't really want my association with them known.</p>

<p>I live in Southern California have a beautiful wife (Kim) and a beautiful new daughter Zoe.</p>

<p>I've been programming professionally for about 12 years but non-stop for about 20. I've worked on various things throughout the years. My initial goal was to develop video games. I found that I'm no good at it and was much better at business.</p>

<p>I have a few open source projects. You can find most of them on <a href='https://github.com/Buildstarted'>Github</a> and <a href='https://github.com/ParrotFx'>ParrotFx</a>. I currently love developing in c# and javascript.</p>

<p>There really isn't much more to say just now - I'll flesh this out later :)</p>
