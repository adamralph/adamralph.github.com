title: Socal Code Camp this weekend

Sunday, January 29th 2012 will be my first foray into public speaking. I'll be speaking at <a href='http://www.socalcodecamp.com/'>Socal Code Camp</a> at Cal State Fullerton about Routing in Asp.Net.

If you're attending my session please come back to this post afterward and leave comments. Positive or negative doesn't matter to me as long as they're constructive. Anything to help improve my future sessions.

Thanks in advance,
