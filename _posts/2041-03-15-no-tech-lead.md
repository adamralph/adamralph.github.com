I've had many discussions about the notion of a 'tech lead' in a team of developers. It's something I feel passionate about as it affects both me personally and the entire software development industry.

Yesterday, I read the blog post [Good Tech Lead, Bad Tech Lead](https://medium.com/p/948b2b806d86) by [Jason Liszka](https://medium.com/@jliszka). Jason's post offers me an ideal reference to argue my views and has prompted me to write this post, for which I'm grateful. This post is at least partially formed as a reaction to Jason's post, which I think is very good and highlights some very important points for a tech lead, *assuming a tech lead exists*.


I challenge the 'tech lead' model and propose that a 'no tech lead' model with a complete focus on teams opposed to individuals is way more productive and a lot more rewarding not just for team members who would otherwise be followers, but for the team member who would otherwise be leading.

<!--excerpt-->

I was a tech lead for a number of years. During that time I believed that the model of a more qualified individual leading with less qualified developers following was a natural method of organisation and I felt qualified to be the tech lead. It was an informal position since I had no official 'lead' title nor subordinates in the org chart but it felt productive and I certainly used it when it came to compensation negotiation.

For the last few years, I've been involved in a far more productive and rewarding model of team organisation. In my current team, we have no tech lead. We have team members with substantially different levels of experience but we have not used this as a means to 'grade' team members and identify a tech lead. Instead, we've used the differences to improve the team as a whole by spreading knowledge by use of various practices, gradually smoothing out differences in skills and experience whilst recognising that individuals will always differ in certain ways and using those lasting differences in positive ways.

This has been far more rewarding for me since I now work in a team which has better levels of experience as a whole. I have far more trust in my team mates. When I am on leave, I have absolute confidence that the team can functionally equally well in my absence (with an according reduction in capacity due to a missing team member). I learn way more since two way communication and learning is continuous throughout the entire team.

One of the motivations for the 'tech lead' model is career progression. Career progression may be important for an individual but it has nothing to do with maximising the productivity of a development team. Skewing the organisation of a development team to meet career progression aspirations of an individual can only be negative for a team.

Compensation justification can often be a major factor and indeed I used my tech lead position to drive my compensation upward in the past. In my view compensation should be something considered outside the *organisation* of a team. Individuals should be compensated according to the value they provide to the team and can also be affected by their relative level of experience and their individual desirability to other companies. Indeed a 'no tech lead' team will evolve to smooth out differences in individuals and should therefore smooth out differences in compensation.

One of the major obstacles is the traditional company hierarchy. Most companies are still formed as vertically oriented hierarchies and people have to be seen to be progressing up org charts in order to justify better compensation. Some companies, such as GitHub, have demonstrated that there is no need for this. However, in most companies, there is still a need for line managers but that is a separate discussion and the reasons are highly removed from anything technical. When this notion of hierarchy leaks down to the technical level, the practices of a team are skewed inappropriately and the effect is counter-productive.

I will now follow the structure of Jason's post and address each of his sections in turn from my 'no tech lead' view.

### Teamwork

Everything listed in 'good' is what *every* member of the team should be doing.

Everything listed in 'bad' outlines some typical problems of *having* a tech lead.

### Technical vision

If the team understand the technical vision then they share it. Why should one person be responsible for it rather than the whole team?

Why delegate? Why does one person know best? The team can self organise. Command and control does not work for software development.

The recognition that team members are smart, trusting them and relying on them is a relationship *all* team members should have with each other.

Everything listed in 'bad' outlines some typical problems of *having* a tech lead.

Technical direction and institutional knowledge are things that the team needs to share through appropriate activities, e.g. whiteboard sessions, backlog grooming. If these things are shared assets of the team then there is rarely a need to produce documentation describing them. Documentation which is regularly produced for this purpose is usually never read.

### Discussion and debate

All members of the team need to be doing the things in 'good'.

In my team we have heated debates and we always manage to settle them somehow. Sometimes, a team member takes the position of mediator and suggests a resolution to a particularly difficult conflict of views. This role emerges organically during the debate and is usually the best person to have taken that role for that given debate. This is better than appointing one person to always mediate regardless and avoids the problems listed in 'bad'.

### Project management

The team should be addressing the things listed in 'good' together.

There should be a shared vision of where the project is heading and this should be reinforced with activities such as whiteboard sessions with domain experts and product owners, and story mapping.

The team should overcome technical roadblocks together.

The team should have continuous knowledge of what everyone is working on making it easy to avoid duplicated effort.

Backlog prioritisation and grooming will highlight areas which are not getting enough attention and the team can self organise to address them.

### Pragmatism

The team should be collectively pragmatic.

The team should identify and agree pragmatic paths to progress during backlog grooming and whilst work is being done through continuous communication, reinforced with code reviews.

Code quality, code reviews and testing are baked into the 'definition of done' agreed by the team.

Management of technical debt and the balance between expediency and perfection are team exercises.

### Communication

Communication is not an overhead. It is the lifeblood of a team.

A team which does not have enough communication is dysfunctional. The things listed in 'good' and 'bad' apply to a team, not an individual.

### Relationship with Product

I would simply replace the term 'tech lead' with 'team' in this entire section.

The team, and not an individual, should have a good relationship with the product manager and domain experts.

During backlog grooming, when a story is identified as requiring more in depth conversation with the product owner or a domain expert, the team can self organise and assign the task to the most effective subset of the team for the given story.

### Resiliency

The team should be displaying all the qualities listed.

Software architecture is not an up-front exercise but is an evolution. The team should own the architecture collectively and evolve it together during backlog grooming, whiteboards sessions, spikes and continuous communication.

## Personality

The 'good' and 'bad' personality traits apply to all team members.

Every team has members with (sometimes widly) varying skills and levels of experience and these should be embraced as the team self organises rather than elevating an individual to a special status.

Team members earn respect *from one another* through technical competence and experience.

The team should always be searching for ways to share the knowledge of more experienced team members with those less experienced. Practices such as pair programming and gated commits spread knowledge through the team, avoid single person dependencies and accelerate the development of less experienced team members. This avoids inappropriate expectations of respect and authority, and feelings of arrogance.
