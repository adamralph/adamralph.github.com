This is a message I try and convey as often as possible to people starting out in open source contribution. To show how easy it is, I sometimes [send a tiny pull request live on stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v091LSnThE&t=36m4s). I don't even have to leave the GitHub web UI.<!--excerpt-->

And this is not something I do only for show. If you were to follow my activity on GitHub you'd see that [I do this for real](https://github.com/damianh/LibLog/pull/86/files). If I'm browsing some source code and I see a typo, why not fix it there and then? Project maintainers (myself included) appreciate these little fixes and polishes. Every little bit helps.

It was heart warming for me to learn that I inspired [Justin Nel](https://twitter.com/Cyberlane) and [Paweł Grudzień](https://twitter.com/BleedingNEdge) when they watched me do this in my talks. They went on to send their own small improvements to [NancyFX](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy.Demo.Samples/pull/3) and [DNX](https://github.com/aspnet/dnx/pull/2936).

Indeed, this is something *all* OSS contributors should bear in mind. Beginners, journeymen and masters alike.

The next time you're browsing some code on GitHub, see if you can spot an opportunity to make a tiny improvement. Click the edit button, and *just do it*. You'll improve the project, even if only a little. All the baby steps add up. Your name will enter the commit history and you'll be a recognised contributor. If it's your first ever pull request, you'll have taken your first step in an exciting journey.
