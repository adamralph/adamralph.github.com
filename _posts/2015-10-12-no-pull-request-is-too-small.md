This is a message I try and convey as often as possible to people starting out in open source contribution. Sometime I even like to demonstrate a one or two line pull request [live on stage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1v091LSnThE&t=36m4s), using the GitHub web UI, just to show how easy it is.

And this is not something I do just for show. If you were to follow my activity on GitHub you'd see that I [do this for real](https://github.com/damianh/LibLog/pull/86/files) too. If I'm browsing some source code and I see a typo, why not just fix it there and then? Project maintainers (myself included) appreciate these little fixes and polishes. Every little bit helps.

It was heart warming for me to learn that [Justin Nel](https://twitter.com/Cyberlane) and [Paweł Grudzień](https://twitter.com/BleedingNEdge) were inspired by watching me do this in my talks and proceeded to send their own small improvements to [NancyFX](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy.Demo.Samples/pull/3) and [DNX](https://github.com/aspnet/dnx/pull/2936).

Indeed, this is something *all* OSS contributors should bear in mind - beginners, journeymen and masters alike.

So the next time you're browsing some code on GitHub and you spot that opportunity to make a tiny improvement, *just do it*.

The project will be improved, even if just a little. All the baby steps add up. Your name will enter the commit history and you'll be a recognised contributor, and, if it's your first ever pull request, you've taken your first step in an exciting journey.
