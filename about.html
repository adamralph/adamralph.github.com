      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>I'm a software developer and an open source advocate with a keen interest in distributed systems design, <abbr title="Domain Driven Design">DDD</abbr>, <abbr title="Command Query Responsibility Segregation">CQRS</abbr> and event sourcing.</p>
      <p>I maintain <a href="/open-source/">several open source products</a> and contribute to many more. In 2014 I had my 15 minutes of fame when I became the first community member to have a pull request accepted for the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/31">.NET Core Framework.</a></p>
      <p>I'm currently enjoying working remotely for <a href="https://particular.net/">Particular Software</a>, the makers of <a href="https://particular.net/nservicebus">NServiceBus</a>. I started writing software for fun and friends in 1983 after my Dad bought me my first computer, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acorn_Electron">Acorn Electron</a>, and I've been delivering commercial software since the mid-'90s.</p>
      <p>My recent family ancestry is a mix from all over Europe, but is predominantly Polish. Being a born and raised Englishman, I naturally drink a lot of tea. (Milk, no sugar, thanks.) Since moving to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flims">Flims, Switzerland</a> in the early '00s, I snowboard <em>a lot</em>. Occasionally, encouraged by my expert girlfriend, I try surfing and have failed spectacularly in all corners of the globe, from the rivers of Switzerland, to the beaches of England, France, Spain, Portugal, and Morocco, to the distant swells of Brazil, Australia, South Africa, Indonesia and Costa Rica.</p>

          <p>Technically he is among the best I have encountered - the functionality and code he delivered were consistently bug-free. Adam's business acumen is second to none. He has an innate ability to understand the true business nature of a problem and his technological solutions are all the better for it.</p>
